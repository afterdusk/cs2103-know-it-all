By: `CS2103-AY2018/19s2-W10-4 Team`      Since: `Mar 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link: https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/knowitall/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test <<folder, folder>> as well (e.g. check link: https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/knowitall/ui/HelpWindow.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and
if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.knowitall.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the
`cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main`)
, you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link: https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link: https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/tree/master/docs/diagrams[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link: https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/knowitall/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDForDeleteCard.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.
//tag::UIdesign[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/knowitall/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

`UI` consists of a `MainWindow` made up of many parts as seen above e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CardMainScreen`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these parts, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart`
class.
//end::UIdesign[]

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files located in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link: https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/knowitall/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is
specified in link: https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Uses `Logic` component to execute user commands.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data to update UI with the modified data.


[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/knowitall/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `CardFolderParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a card).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteCardSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

//tag::modeldesign[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/knowitall/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores a list of `VersionedCardFolders` representing the folders that the user has. These `VersionedCardFolders` in turn each store a list of `Cards`. Each `Card` stores information about a single question.
* exposes unmodifiable instances of `FilteredList<Card>` and `FilteredList<VersionedCardFolder>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes two instances of `SimpleObjectProperty<Card>`, which represent the current cards being selected and being tested, if any.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

//end::modeldesign[]

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can change the `Card` implementation to be that of a parent class, from which 2 subclasses, `SingleAnswerCard` and `McqCard` can inherit from. This would eliminate the need for the `Card` class to maintain a Set of MCQ `Options` even if it is a Single-answer card. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/knowitall/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back. It maintains a single instance of `UserPrefStorage`.
* can save `CardFolder` data in json format and read it back. It holds a list of `CardFolderStorage` objects, each handling the storage functions of a single `CardFolder`.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.knowitall.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::cards[]
=== Cards
==== Current Implementation
The `Card` is one of the core aspects of the application. Cards are the result of morphing the `Person` class from the original AddressBook model. This implementation incorporates the `Model` and `Logic` components.

[discrete]
==== Model
To allow users to manage Cards, the following methods are available via the `Model` component:

* `ModelManager#addCard(Card card)` - Adds a new card to the currently active `VersionedCardFolder` folder
* `ModelManager#setCard(Card target, Card editedCard)` - Edits the information of a target card in the currently active folder
* `ModelManager#deleteCard(Card target)` - Deletes the target card from the currently active folder
* `ModelManager#hasCard(Card card)` - Checks if a card is already present in the currently active folder

[discrete]
==== Logic
As with all other commands, the `LogicManager#execute(String commandText)` method of the `Logic` component parses the user's input, say a command to add a new card, and executes the corresponding `Command`.

[discrete]
==== Example Usage

The following steps detail the underlying logic executed when a user does a card-related operation, say an add card operation.

1. User is in the `Organs` folder and wants to add a new card, with question 'What is the largest organ?' and answer 'Skin'. This is done by typing `add q/What is the largest organ? a/Skin`.
+
image:CardImplementationAddExample.png[width="800"]

2. The command parser reads the string input (as entered by the user) and returns the corresponding `Command`, an `AddCommand` object in this instance.

3. Upon execution, the `AddCommand` checks if the card to be added is already present in the current folder. If so, an exception is thrown.

4. The `AddCommand` then calls the `ModelManager#addCard(Card card)` method.

5. The new card will then be added to the active `VersionedCardFolder`.

6. If the user is not inside a folder, or if the card to add already exists inside the current folder, the `addCommand` will throw a `CommandException`.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates how `AddCommand` works.

image:AddCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to represent options for MCQ cards

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Maintain a set of `Option` objects to represent incorrect options, separate from the `Answer` field of each `Card`.
** Pros: Simple to implement, easy to convert the card type between MCQ and Single-answer, requires the least amount of implementation changes to `Card`.
** Cons: Single-answer cards still have to maintain an empty `Option` set.
* **Alternative 2:** Maintain 2 separate subclasses of `Card`, one for Single-answer and another for MCQ.
** Pros: More object-oriented implementation.
** Cons: Harder to implement.

// end::cards[]

// tag::score[]
=== Score feature
==== Current Implementation

To implement tracking of the number of correct and incorrect attempts, a new attribute `Score` was added to `Card`.
Score keeps track of both numbers.
This attribute is encapsulated in the `Score` class.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to represent score

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Track total number of correct attempts and total number of attempts
** Pros: Simple to implement. Most semantically correct.
** Cons: Score will be rolling average. If the question is answered wrongly even once, the score can never be 100%.
* **Alternative 2:** Track only last X attempts.
** Pros: An improvement in performance will be more obvious.
** Cons: Uses more memory. Have to delete the X+1th score every time a new score is added.

===== Aspect: How to read/write score from file

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Read/write as `String`.
** Pros: `String`s are easier to read/write to file.
** Cons: There must be strict checks when instantiating score from strings as they are prone to many kinds of formatting errors.
* **Alternative 2:** Read/write as a double.
** Pros: A `double` can represent both numbers with just one, which then can be converted to `String`.
** Cons: When instantiating score from double, it might be simplified.
For example, 2 correct attempts and 4 total attempts becomes 0.5. When instantiating from double, it is interpreted as 1 correct attempt and 2 total attempts.
* **Alternative 3:** Read and write both numbers as integers.
** Pros: Most correct implementation.
** Cons: Reading/writing to file now needs to take into account this fact. The `toString()` method cannot be used to write to file.

// end::score[]


// tag::report[]
=== Report feature
==== Current Implementation

The report feature is meant to provide the user with the ability to look back and compare their test score from
previous test sessions. It makes use of Java FXML features to display scores in a user-friendly manner. The following
methods are used to enter or exit the report display:

* `Model#enterReportDisplay()` -- Enters the report display for this folder.
* `Model#exitReportDisplay()` -- Exits the report display back into the folder.

Here is a screenshot of how it looks:

image:ReportDisplay.png[width="800"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the report display is rendered.

Step 1. The user is in a folder and wishes to see a report by executing `report`.

Step 2. A `ReportCommand` is created and executed by `LogicManager`. `Model#enterReportDisplay()` is called, which prepares
the model for report by sorting the cards by lowest scores first. The state is also checked to make sure the user is in
a folder.

Step 3. A `CommandResult` with type `ENTERED_REPORT` is returned by the `ReportCommand`.

Below is a sequence diagram, summarizing the above operations.

.Sequence Diagram for Report Command
image:ReportCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 4. The `CommandResult` is passed to UI, which now has to render the new screen. It does so by getting the current
 `CardFolder` from Model, then instantiating a `ReportDisplay` with it. `ReportDisplay` prepares several elements for
 display by Java FXML, split by their content:

 * `ReportDisplay#displayTitle()` -- Displays title and how many test scores were recorded.
 * `ReportDisplay#displayGraph()` -- Takes maximum of last 10 test scores from `CardFolder`, and
 adds them as points on the Java FXML `AreaChart`.
 * `ReportDisplay#displayQuestions()` -- Displays maximum of 3 questions from `CardFolder` which have lowest the
 individual <<cardscore, card scores>>.
  * `ReportDisplay#displayTagline()` -- Calculates change in test score from last and second last test session
  (if available) and formats it in a user-friendly manner.

Step 5. The `ReportDisplay` is rendered by `fullScreenPlaceholder`.

Below is a sequence diagram summarizing steps 4 and 5. The interactions with Java FXML elements are omitted for clarity.

.Sequence diagram for Report Display
image:ReportDisplaySequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to display test scores

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display previous test scores in a graph and lowest scoring cards
** Pros: Has benefits of seeing the graph as well as knowing which cards the user needs help in.
** Cons: More performance and memory intensive. Screen may get messy if there are too many items.
* **Alternative 2:** Display previous test scores in a graph
** Pros: More visual, easier to see change in test score.
** Cons: More performance and memory intensive as a graph needs to be rendered. Remedy: Display only last ten.
* **Alternative 3:** List the previous test scores
** Pros: User can see more accurate numbers. They can also see the individual card scores, so that
they can tell where they need help.
** Cons: Hard to see change from test session to test session.

===== Aspect: Where to display test scores
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display in full screen, entered from card folder
** Pros: Works because the test scores are scored by card folders.
** Cons: Need to implement a new state for commands, because it should not be possible to do some e.g. add card while
in fullscreen report.
* **Alternative 2:** Display in right panel, with cards on the left
** Pros: User can see all their cards at the same time.
** Cons: Less space to render report details such as graph.

// end::report[]

// tag::state[]
=== State
==== Current Implementation
===== Model
Previously, Model did not have a concept of state as there was only one screen where the user could be. But
as Know-It-All grew, there are more screens that a user can be in and more commands that can only be executed in certain
screens. Thus there is a need to manage the state in Model.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to manage state

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use enum of States
** Pros: Fixes the states that Model can be in. By design, only one state can be true at any point in time, if state is set to type State which is a enum.
** Cons: Need to add new states to enum.
* **Alternative 2:** Use Strings
** Pros: No need to define new states. Trivial to change into new state: Simply set state to "folder", or "homeDir". Easy to check as well, e.g. to Check state == "folder".
** Cons: Becomes very unsafe as even a typo would mean entering a state that other parts of the application would not understand.
e.g. Setting state to "Folder" instead of "folder".
* **Alternative 2:** Use boolean flags
** Pros: Easy to manipulate. Clear when there are only two states.
** Cons: Becomes very messy when there are more states, since there is a need to ensure that only one boolean flag
is true at any point in time. E.g., only one of inFolder, inHomeDir, inTest... can be true.

// end::state[]

//tag::importexport[]
=== Import/Export feature
[discrete]
==== Current Implementation
The Import and Export feature is facilitated by the Logic and model components, together
with the addition of 3 new classes inside the csvmanager package defined under
the storage package.

[discrete]
===== Logic
Similar to how the current commands are implemented, where each specific command inherits from the abstract
class command, the Import and Export command likewise inherit from the command class.


[discrete]
===== Model
The model component supports the addition of a new object attribute `CsvManager`, that carries out the read and
write logic of cards to external files.

Additionally, model implements two new methods, `Model#importCardFolders` and `Model#exportCardFolders`.
These two methods further call the CsvManager API to read and write card folders.

Model also implements `Model#setTestCsvPath` and the `Model#getDefaultPath` which are only used during testing.

[discrete]
===== csvmanager package:
The csvmanager package contains all classes dealing with the reading and writing of card folders into and out to
the model.

The classes include:

* `CsvManager` - Main class responsible for the writing and reading of .csv files during the import and export of files
* `CsvFile` - Wrapper class for file name input by user
* `CsvCommands` interface - API for import/export method in CsvManager
* `CsvUtils` - Utility class containing the default path and test paths used by the application.

The main logic for the import / export command is carried out inside the CsvManager class specified by it's
API `CsvManager#writeFoldersToCsv` and `CsvManager#readFoldersToCsv`.


[discrete]
===== Example Usage
1. User wants to export folders Human Anatomy and Nervous System.
Suppose that these two folders index as shown on the main application screen is 1 and 3 respectively.
The user types ``export 1 3``

2. The Export command parser extracts the indices, stores the indices into a `List<Integer>` and
`ExportCommand` object, which keeps track of the indices.


3. The Export command calls executes, resulting in a call to the  `Model#exportCardFolders` method.

4. `Model#exportCardFolders` method checks that all card folders specified by user exists within the model.
   With reference to the diagram below, we can see that the indices specified by the user (1 and 3) corresponds to the
   (i - 1) th indexes of the list of card folders in the model,
   where 1 < i <= no.of card folders in model. +
   The method throws `CardFolderNotFoundException` if card folder index is not found in list.
+
image::import_export_model_list1.png[width = "800"]


5.  `CsvManager` is called to carry out the main logic of writing the card folders to file.
    File exported will be created in the project root directory. +
    Names of the files created will correspond to the names of their corresponding card folders. +
    i.e `Human Anatomy.csv` and `Nervous System.csv`

6. User wants to import `Human Anatomy.csv` file.
`Human Anatomy.csv` file contains flashcards represented in csv file format.
User types `import Blood.csv` command

7. Import command parser extracts file name, wraps file into a `CsvFile` object and
   parses the `CsvFile` object into an Import Command object.

8. Logic unit executes the import command.
The execute method makes a call to `Model#importCardFolder` method. The model checks that
the card folder to import does not already exist within the model. Throws `DuplicateCardFolderException`
if card folder already exists.

9. CsvManager is called to carry out the main logic of reading card folders to file.
File imported will be serialized into a `CardFolder` object and
added to the `folders` variable in model.


NOTE: Both Imported and Exported files have to be placed in the project root directory.

The below diagram shows the sequence diagram for the Import/Export commands

image::import_export_sequenceDiagram.png[width = "1000"]

==== CSV file structure
Example of a common cardfolder csv file, opened using microsoft excel. +

Blood.csv

image::Blood.png[width= '800']

* The first line of any file contains the headers for each card.
These headers have to be present in the csv file. If not the import would not work.

* Each row of the csv file starting from the second,
represents a single flashcard.

* Option headers i.e (Option,Option,Option)
can be left blank or take on 1 value.

* Hints header can take either 0 or 1 value.

//end::importexport[]



==== Design Considerations
//tag::design_considerations_import_export[]

===== Aspect: Which component responsible for import/export logic
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Implement read and write card folders in StorageManager class
** Pros: The most intuitive solution,
since Storage involves read and write logic
** Cons:
*** Either Logic and Model will be more coupled with storage. Storage also has more than one responsibility now.
* **Alternative 2**:Implement read/write and other logic in another class. (Current)
** Pros: Separate responsibilities of both Storage and Model. Model class can focus on the representation of the in-memory card folders
and Storage class can focus on managing the internal card folder data (.json files)
** Cons: More code to write. Storage class could possibly call the relevant API's
to convert .json file  into .csv file


===== Aspect: Csv file design structure
* **Alternative 1**: Export multiple card folders into a single file.

** Pros: Saves user trouble of calling multiple import for files. +
Each card folder is separated by a new line.
** Cons: Not a .csv file anymore. First line header would now specify cardfolder name before card headers,
leading to unequal rows and columns
* **Alternative 2**: Export each card folder into a single file (Current)
** Pros: More flexibility for users to import desired card folders,
since 1 cardfolder = 1 csv file. Files are also now correctly formatted as .csv file
and Storage class can focus on managing the internal card folder data (.json files)
** Cons: Slightly more work needed to import multiple card folders.
//end::design_considerations_import_export[]


//tag::folders[]
=== Folders
==== Current Implementation
A folder is another layer of abstraction over a `CardFolder`. Where we dealt with a single `CardFolder` in previous iterations, we now have multiple `CardFolders` that each have their own set of `Cards`. Users are able to manage each `CardFolder` independently.

Folders in the application are achieved via enhancements from the AddressBook implementation. The changes span across all four components (UI, Logic, Model and Storage).

===== Model
Previously, an instance of `ModelManager` contained only a single `VersionedCardFolder`, holding the current and previous state of the `CardFolder`. To support multiple folders, `ModelManager` now holds an `ObservableList` of `CardFolders`. The change is illustrated in the figure below, with the original implementation on the left and new implementation on the right.

image::ModelEnhancementDiagram.png[width="800"]

To allow users to operate on multiple `CardFolders`, the following notable methods were also introduced:

* `ModelManager#addFolder(CardFolder cardfolder)` - Adds a specified cardfolder to the `ModelManager`’s list
* `ModelManager#deleteFolder(int index)` - Deletes the `CardFolder` at the specified index in the `ModelManager's` list
* `ModelManager#getActiveCardFolderIndex()` - Gets the index of the current active `CardFolder`
* `ModelManager#enterFolder(int index)` - Specifies the active `CardFolder` for operations to be performed on via the index in `ModelManager`’s list and sets the boolean `inFolder` to `true` to denote that user is inside a folder.
* `ModelManager#exitFolderToHome()` - Sets the boolean `inFolder` to `false` to indicate that the user is at the home directory.
* `ModelManager#renameFolder(int index, String newName)` - Renames the folder at the specified index in the `ModelManager's` list to the new name.
* `ModelManager#getState()` - Returns the current state of the `ModelManager`. The possible states are {`IN_FOLDER`, `IN_HOMEDIR`, `IN_TEST`, `IN_REPORT`}.

===== Storage
Similarly, the `StorageManager` needs to represent each `CardFolder` separately. In the same manner as in the Model component, we introduce a list of `JsonCardFolderStorages`. The change is illustrated in the figure below, with the original implementation on the left and new implementation on the right.

image::StorageEnhancementDiagram.png[width="800"]

Notable new methods:

* `StorageManager#readCardFolders()` - Reads in all `CardFolders` from all `CardFolderStorage` objects in the list.
* `StorageManager#saveCardFolders(List<ReadOnlyCardFolder> cardFolders)` - Saves all `CardFolders` provided in the argument to the user's data directory.

===== Logic
The existing implementation of the Logic component propagates changes in a Model's `CardFolder` to the Storage component. With listeners, it is informed when a `CardFolder` is modified (e.g. a new card is added) so that it can invoke the appropriate Storage methods.

The same principle was applied to propagate changes regarding `CardFolders` themselves (and not their stored cards) to Storage: e.g. adding a new folder. Model is now an `Observable`, and changes to a Model’s `CardFolders` will inform the `LogicManager`, which in turn invokes `StorageManager#saveCardFolders(List<ReadOnlyCardFolder> cardFolders)`.

To illustrate how the Model, Storage and Logic components interact, below is a walkthrough of a typical usage scenario of the `addfolder` command. <<addfoldersequencediagram>> is a sequence diagram that summarises the example:

* Step 1. The `addfolder` command is executed. For example, `addfolder f`.

* Step 2. As with every command, the command parser reads the input and generates the relevant `Command` object, in this case an `AddFolderCommand`. The object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

[NOTE]
If the input is invalid (e.g. user did not provide a folder name or provided one that violated the constraints of folder names), Step 2 would not proceed and an error message is displayed. The Model and Storage components would not be modified.

* Step 3. The `LogicManager` executes the `AddFolderCommand`, Before transferring control to the Model component with the `ModelManager#addFolder()` method, a few checks are performed to ensure that the user is inside a folder and the model does not already have a folder with the same name (not shown in sequence diagram).

[NOTE]
If any of the aforementioned checks do not succeed, Step 3 would end in a Command Exception being thrown and would not proceed. Model and Storage components would not be modified.

* Step 4. The `ModelManager` creates a `VersionedCardFolder` to represent the newly created folder, storing a reference to its currently empty list of cards. Before returning control to the Logic component, `ModelManager#indicateModified()` is invoked to notify listeners in the `LogicManager` that the list of `CardFolders` have changed.

* Step 5. The Logic component takes over control and checks if the `ModelManager` is modified. In the case of `addfolder` the object is indeed modified (as a result of Step 4) and thus the component proceeds to save the Model's `CardFolders` to Storage.

* Step 6. Before handing over control to Storage, the `LogicManager` obtains the information to save and the path to save to with `ModelManager#getCardFolders()` and `ModelManager#getCardFoldersFilesPath()` respectively. It then passes these objects as parameters when it calls `StorageManager#saveCardFolders()`.

* Step 7. The Storage component receives control, with the `StorageManager` clearing the directory of data files at the specified path and creating `JsonCardFolderStorage` objects with path names equivalent to the names of the folders it has received. It then proceeds to invoke `JsonCardFolderStorage#saveCardFolder()` on all the `JsonCardFolderStorage` to save all the folders before returning to the `LogicManager`.

[NOTE]
If the path provided by the Model Component is invalid, the Storage component throws an exception and an error message is displayed. The changes made to Model are not saved and the command does not execute successfully.

* Step 8. The `LogicManager` terminates and returns the result of the command to the calling method.

===== UI

As folders are a layer of abstraction over the cards, there is a need for the GUI to represent this abstraction for greater clarity and ease of use for the user. This is done by introducing the `FolderListPanel` class, which displays a list of all folders that the user has.

The `fullScreenPlaceholder:StackPane` object houses the content in the main window of our application. Depending on whether the user is in the home directory or within a folder, different UI objects are placed within `fullScreenPlaceholder`.

* When the user is in the home directory, `fullScreenPlaceholder` holds a `FolderListPanel` to display all the folders in a list inside the main window.

* When the user is within a folder, `fullScreenPlaceholder` holds a `CardMainScreen` object, which is composed of a `CardListPanel` and `BrowserPanel`. These represent the list of cards on the scrolling sidebar, as well as the card viewer on the right. The content within the `CardMainScreen` depends on the particular folder the user has navigated into, as different folders hold different cards.

To better understand how the UI is updated, below is a walkthrough of what happens when the user enters a folder. Refer to the sequence diagram in <<enterfoldersequencediagram>> for a visual representation:

* Step 1. The Logic component informs the UI component that the user has entered a folder. The UI component responds by invoking `MainWindow#handleEnterFolder()`.

* Step 2. UI retrieves the list of cards belonging to the entered folder from the `LogicManager`.

* Step 3. A new `CardListPanel` is created with the information obtained in Step 2.

* Step 4. The new `CardListPanel` from Step 3, together with the existing `BrowserPanel`, are used to create a new `CardMainScreen` object.

* Step 5. The content held by `fullScreenPlaceholder` is replaced with the newly generated `CardMainScreen`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How multiple folders are represented in Model
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: List of structures representing individual folders
** Pros: Scalable and better follows OOP principles.
** Cons: Hard to implement, alters fundamental architecture of components.
* **Alternative 2**: A single structure containing `Cards` with information on their folder membership (folder operations performed by iterating over all cards)
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Not scalable, will be computationally expensive to perform folder operations when there are many cards and/or folders.

*Evaluation*: On the account of how computationally expensive it would be to parse through thousands of cards every card or folder operation, the first alternative was chosen and time was set aside to overcome the technical challenge of implementing the choice.

===== Aspect: Folder identification
* **Alternative 1**: Use a unique folder name
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: The undo/redo feature would not be compatible with this approach, as checking equality between different versions of a folder across time necessarily requires the comparison of cards.
* **Alternative 2**: Identify a folder by its cards
** Pros: There can be no folders with identical cards, preventing redundancy.
** Cons: Two folders could have identical names as long as the cards are different, which is potentially confusing.
* **Alternative 3 (current choice)**: Mixed approach, use Alternative 1 for comparing different folders and Alternative 2 for comparing the same folder across time
** Pros: Reaps the benefits of both approaches without the disadvantages.
** Cons: Difficult to implement and for future developers to grasp the difference between the two types of comparisons.

*Evaluation*: While it was difficult the implement, Alternative 3 was chosen due to the immense limitations of the first two approaches. The third alternative had little to no downside apart from requiring time to understand and implement.

===== Aspect: Storage file name and folder name
* **Alternative 1**: Let folder name be the file name of the storage file
** Pros: Less ambiguity as to how file name is related to folder name, able to find storage file path with folder name.
** Cons: Harder to retrieve folder name from the file as it requires parsing the path, more prone to data corruption as file name could be modified when application is running (although this could be overcome with some OS-level syscalls to lock the file).
* **Alternative 2 (current choice)**: Let file name be independent of folder name, which is stored inside the storage file itself
** Pros: Easier to implement and avoids dependency on existing storage files after application starts.
** Cons: When saving folders from Model, it is difficult to match folders with existing storage files. Hence, rather than saving the modified folder, it is more feasible to clear the directory and save all folders. This is computationally expensive and may not be scalable beyond a certain size.

*Evaluation*: While in the long-run, the first alternative appears to better decision, time limitations make Alternative 2 good enough for most practical use cases. The saved time was used to implement other features.

===== Aspect: What folders to generate in the event corrupted storage files are encountered
* **Alternative 1**: Display a sample folder
** Pros: Easy to implement, guaranteed that application will not be empty with no folders displayed.
** Cons: Non-corrupted folders will not be displayed and will potentially be overwritten.
* **Alternative 2**: Display non-corrupted folders
** Pros: Non-corrupted data is preserved.
** Cons: If all data is corrupted, an empty application is presented to the user.
* **Alternative 3 (current choice)**: Mixed approach, display all non-corrupted folders unless all data is corrupted, in which case display sample folder
** Pros: Has the advantages but not the disadvantages of Alternatives 1 and 2.
** Cons: More difficult to implement, developers will need to pay special attention to understand this behaviour.

*Evaluation*: Alternative 3 was deemed the most logical choice because it achieves the important objectives of retaining non-corrupted user data, while always ensuring there is data for the user to work with even if he/she is starting the application for the first time.

=== Navigating folders

==== Current Implementation

===== Navigation State

The state of the application with regard to navigation (i.e. whether a user is inside of a folder or at the home directory) affects the types of commands available to the user.

* The commands that affect cards (e.g. adding a card, editing a card) are executed within folders and are known as *Card Operations*.
* Commands that affect folders (e.g. adding a folder, deleting a folder) are only executable at the home directory and are known as *Folder Operations*.

Please refer to the User Guide for the full list of commands under both categories.

To keep track of navigation state, an enum `State` is maintained by the `ModelManager`. Other components may retrieve the current state with `ModelManager#getState()`. This is also how the `Command` objects determines whether the command is executable in the present navigation state.

===== Change Directory Command

Folder navigation is achieved by the user through the use of the `cd` command. As navigating folders do not actually modify folders and their cards, folder navigation does not involve the Storage Component.

The change directory command has the following formats:

1. `cd ..` - Returns the user to the home directory. This command can only be executed when the user is inside a folder.
2. `cd FOLDER_INDEX` - Enters the folder specified by `FOLDER_INDEX`. This command can only be executed from the home directory, when the user is not in any folder.

When a `cd` command is executed, the Logic component parses the command and creates a `ChangeDirectoryCommand` object. If the command is of the first format, `ChangeDirectoryCommand()` is invoked without any arguments and the boolean `isExitingFolder` is set to `true`. If the command is of the second format, the overloaded constructor `ChangeDirectoryCommand(FOLDER_INDEX)` is instead called and `isExitingFolder` is set to `false`.

`ChangeDirectoryCommand#execute()` is then invoked. The value of `isExitingFolder` will determine the corresponding methods in `ModelManager` that are called (`exitFoldersToHome()` or `enterFolder()`). The sequence diagram in <<changecommandsequencediagram>> illustrates this conditional choice and the interactions involved with each option.

[[changecommandsequencediagram]]
.Component interactions for `cd` command
image::ChangeCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="600"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Command format to enter and exit folders
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use variations of the same command (e.g. `cd ..` and `cd INDEX` )
** Pros: More intuitive and akin to other Command Line applications.
** Cons: Harder to implement as the logic for parsing the command is different from that of existing commands.
* **Alternative 2**: Use distinct commands (e.g. `home` and `enter INDEX`)
** Pros: Commands would function similar to other commands in the application.
** Cons: Harder for the user to get acquainted with as there are two separate commands with logically similar functionality; introduces redundancy.

*Evaluation*: This matter is highly subjective and conflicting feedback was received during testing. However, we believe that our target audience, a user familiar with the command line, would be more used to navigation with a single command and as such would prefer Alternative 1.
//end::folders[]

//tag::testcommand[]
=== Test Session feature

==== Overall Current Implementation
This big feature mainly involves `UI`, `Logic` and `Model` components.

There are 3 main variables in `ModelManager` introduced to keep track of the current state of the user in a test
session.

* `currentTestedCardFolder`
** The current card folder that the user is running a test session on (stored as an `ObservableList` of cards) .
** Set to null if user is not inside a test session

* `currentTestedCard`
** The current card the user is seeing in the test session, obtained from `currentTestedCardFolder` using
`currentTestedCardIndex`.
** Set to null if user is not inside a test session
** Related methods:
*** `ModelManager#setCurrentTestedCard(Card card)` - set `currentTestedCard` to the card specified.
*** `ModelManager#getCurrentTestedCard()` - returns the `currentTestedCard`.

* `cardAlreadyAnswered`
** A boolean variable to indicate if the user has already executed a valid answer command for the current card.
** Related methods:
*** `ModelManager#setCardAsAnswered()` - set `cardAlreadyAnswered` to true.
*** `ModelManager#setCardAsNotAnswered()` - set `cardAlreadyAnswered` to false.
*** `ModelManager#isCardAlreadyAnswered()` - returns true if the current card has already been answered and false
otherwise.

==== Overall Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Usage of an extra card variable to keep track of the current card in test session

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Introduce another variable, `currentTestedCard`, to store the card to display
in the test session.
** Pros: More reader friendly. Save time from accessing the list to get card at that index.
** Cons: Extra space used.

* **Alternative 2**: No introduction of `currentTestedCard` as using the `currentTestedCardIndex` suffices. Every time a
card is needed, can simply reference it using `currentTestedCardFolder#getIndex(currentTestedCardIndex)`.
** Pros: No need to store an extra variable so this method uses less space.
** Cons: Not so reader friendly. Need to keep accessing the list using the index which can potentially lead to
possible violation of the Law of Demeter where an object should only interact with objects that are closely related to it.

*Evaluation*:
We went with Alternative 1 since not a large amount of memory is taken up with just 1 extra card stored. As there will
be several references to the `currentTestedCard`, it will be better to store them somewhere. Abiding by the Law
of Demeter, `currentTestedCard` object will not be interacting with `currentTestedCardFolder`,  limiting its
knowledge of that object which is encouraged according to the Principle of Least Knowledge.


==== Test / End Command

===== Current Implementation

[discrete]
====== Model
The main logic for  `test` and `end` command is carried out in `ModelManager` with the following methods:

* `ModelManager#startTestSession()` - begins a test session on the current card folder user is in and implicitly sorts
the cards in it.
* `ModelManager#endTestSession()` - ends the current test session.

[discrete]
====== UI
To update the change in the UI to reflect that the user is a test session (app goes to full screen with question of
the current card presented), the following methods are introduced.

* `MainWindow#handleStartTestSession(Card card)` - creates a new `TestSession` page with the card specified and bring
 the page forward in front of the current `CardMainScreen` page.
* `MainWindow#handleEndTestSession()` - deletes the current `TestSession` page and the `CardMainScreen` page at the back
 is now presented to the user.

[discrete]
====== Example Usage of test command

To illustrate how the `UI`, `Model` and `Logic` components interact, below is a walkthrough of a typical usage scenario of
the test command.
<<testcommandsequencediagram>> is a sequence diagram that summarises `Model` and `Logic` interactions, namely steps 1 to 7.

**Step 1**. User is inside a folder and wants to begin a test session on the current folder by executing the command
`test`.

**Step 2**. As with every command, the command parser reads the input and generates the relevant `Command` object, in
this case a `TestCommand`. The object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 3**. The `LogicManager` executes the `TestCommand`, storing the result and then transferring control to the
Model component, with `Model#getState()` to check that user is inside a folder and is not already in a test session.
(This is omitted from <<testcommandsequencediagram>> for simplicity.)

[NOTE]
If the user is not inside a folder, this test command would be rendered invalid. Step 4 would not proceed and an
error message is displayed.

**Step 4**. After checking user is in a folder, `ModelManager#startTestSession()` method is invoked, which
does the following:

1. `currentTestedCardFolder` is set to the current folder the user is in, by invoking `getCardList()` from the active
`VersionedCardFolder` in `folders`.
[NOTE]
If this folder is empty such that there is no card to present to the user, an `EmptyCardFolderException` is thrown,
to be caught in `TestCommand`, which then throws a `CommandException` to display an error message.

2. The cards in this folder are sorted in ascending scores by invoking `sortFilteredCard(comparator)`, so that
lowest score cards will be presented first to the user in a test session.
3. `ModelManager#setCurrentTestedCard(currentTestedCardIndex)` is then invoked to set `currentTestedCard` to the first
card in the folder as `currentTestedCardIndex` is set to 0.
4. `state` in `Model` is set to `IN_TEST` to specify that user is in a test session from now onwards.
5. No change to `cardAlreadyAnswered` as it is by default false.

**Step 5**. For `TestCommand` to obtain the first card to present in the test session,
`ModelManager#getCurrentTestedCard()` is invoked and the `Card`, `c`, is returned.

**Step 6**. With control now transferred back to the logic unit, `TestCommand` creates a `CommandResult` object, `r` with the type `START_TEST_SESSION`, and
set `testSessionCard` in `CommandResult` to `c` obtained in Step 5.

**Step 7**. `r` is returned to `LogicManager` which then terminates and returns `r` to the caller method.

**Step 8**. The caller method here is in `MainWindow`. Control is now transferred to the UI component.

**Step 9**. `MainWindow` sees that `CommandResult` object `r` has the type `START_TEST_SESSION`. It invokes
`MainWindow#handleStartTestSession(currentTestedCard)` to display the `currentTestedCard` question and hints to the
user.

//end::testcommand[]

[[exampleusageofendcommand]]
[discrete]
====== Example Usage of end command

**Step 1**. User is currently in a test session and executes the command `end`.

**Step 2**. An `EndCommand` object is created and `LogicManager` executes the `EndCommand`, storing the result and then
transferring control to the Model component, with `Model#getState()` to check that user is indeed in a test session.

[NOTE]
If the user is not in a test session, Step 3 would not proceed.

**Step 3**. `ModelManager#endTestSession()` method is invoked, which does the following:

1. `currentTestedCardFolder` is set to null.
2. `ModelManager#setCurrentTestedCard(null)` is invoked to set `currentTestedCard` to null.
3. `state` in `Model` is set to `IN_FOLDER` to specify that user is back in the folder.
4. `ModelManager#setCardAsNotAnswered()` is invoked.

**Step 4**. As control is now transferred back to the logic unit, `EndCommand` creates a `CommandResult` object, `r` with
the type `END_TEST_SESSION`.

**Step 5**. `r` is returned to `LogicManager` which then terminates and returns `r` to the caller in `MainWindow`. Control is now transferred to the UI component.

**Step 6**. `MainWindow` sees that `CommandResult` object `r` has the type `END_TEST_SESSION`. It invokes
`MainWindow#handleEndTestSession()` to delete the current `testSession` page, presenting `cardMainScreen` page at the
back (the screen the user was seeing before entering the test session) to the user.

//tag::testdesign[]
===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: Way to execute a test/end command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: `test` is executed when inside a folder. The user does not have to specify the
folder index and `test` would just immediately display the first card in this current folder.
** Pros: The most logical way of carrying out a test session is when the user is in the folder that he or she wants to
 be tested on. Lesser dependency on entering and exiting folder methods.
** Cons: Requires the extra step of entering the folder before it can test the folder. User may actually see the questions before the test session.

* **Alternative 2**: `test` is executed when outside a folder, in the home directory. Test command would require a
folder index, e.g `test 1` to test the first folder. Implementation of getting the card from the folder would rely on
enter folder command as well.
** Pros: Fast way to enter test session from home directory
** Cons: Not logical for `test` to be called from inside the home directory which should only allow folder operations.
`test` will then have to implicitly enter the folder to gain access to the cards in it in order to display them,
creating a
dependency between the test and enter folder commands.
Similar issue will arise for the end test session command where user will need to implicitly exit the folder.

*Evaluation*:
Overall, Alternative 1 is a better choice following the Single Level of Abstraction Principle(SLAP) where a function
should not mix different levels of abstractions. We can then better achieve higher cohesion and lower coupling.
Also, user being able to see the questions before the test session is not a big issue since the answer will not be shown unless user selects the card.

//end::testdesign[]

==== Answer Command
===== Current Implementation

[discrete]
====== Model
To facilitate the marking of attempted answer, we introduce the following method in `ModelManager`.

* `ModelManager#markAttemptedAnswer(Answer attemptedAnswer)` - returns true if attemptedAnswer is correct and
false if attemptedAnswer is wrong. It compares the attempted answer and the correct answer obtained from the current
card.

[NOTE]
Comparison is not case-sensitive

[discrete]
====== Logic
To facilitate the update of score after marking the card, we introduce the following method in `ModelManager`.

* `ModelManager#createScoredCard(Card cardToMark, boolean markCorrect)` - creates a new card with the
updated score.

[discrete]
====== UI
To update the change in the `UI` to show the user the result of the marked answer, whether it is correct or wrong, the following methods are introduced.

* `MainWindow#handleCorrectAnswer()` - updates current `TestSession` page to green colour background with correct
answer and correct answer description.
* `MainWindow#handleWrongAnswer()` - updates current `TestSession` page to red colour background with correct answer
and wrong answer description.

[discrete]
====== Example Usage of answer command

To illustrate how the components interact, below is a walkthrough of a typical usage scenario of the answer command.
<<answercommandsequencediagram>> is a sequence diagram that summarises `Model` and `Logic` interactions, namely steps 1
to 8.

**Step 1**. User is in a test session and wants to answer the question on the card currently presented by executing
`ans four`.

**Step 2**. An `AnswerCommand` object is created and `LogicManager` executes the `AnswerCommand`, storing the result and
then transferring control to the Model component, with `Model#getState()` and
`ModelManager#isCardAlreadyAnswered()` to check that user is indeed in a test session and has not attempted an answer
 already. (This is omitted from <<answercommandsequencediagram>> for simplicity.)

[NOTE]
If the user is not in a test session or already attempted an answer for the current card, this `ans` command would be
rendered invalid. Step 3 would not proceed and an error message is displayed.

**Step 3**. After both checks have passed, `ModelManager#setCardAsAnswered()` is invoked.

**Step 4**. `ModelManager` now marks the attempted answer by invoking `ModelManager#markAttemptedAnswer(attemptedAnswer)`.

**Step 5**. Given the result of the attempt, a new card exactly the same as the current
card but with the updated score is created and replaces the current one by invoking `ModelManager#createScoredCard(Card
cardToMark, boolean markCorrect)` followed by `Model#setCard(cardToMark, scoredCard)`.

**Step 6**. To complete the update in the change in score, `Model#updateFilteredCard(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_CARDS)` and
`Model#commitActiveCardFolder()` are invoked.

**Step 7**. `AnswerCommand` now creates a `CommandResult` object, `r` with either type `ANSWER_CORRECT` or `ANSWER_WRONG`
 depending on the outcome of the attempt.

**Step 8**. `r` is returned to `LogicManager` which then terminates and returns `r` to the caller.

**Step 9**. The caller method is in `MainWindow`. Control is now transferred to the UI component.

**Step 10**. If `MainWindow` sees that `CommandResult` object `r` has the type `ANSWER_CORRECT`, it invokes
`MainWindow#handleCorrectAnswer()` to display the correct attempt `TestSession` page to the user.
If `MainWindow` sees that `CommandResult` object `r` has the type `ANSWER_WRONG`, it invokes
`MainWindow#handleWrongAnswer()` to display the wrong attempt `TestSession` page to the user.

==== Next Command
===== Current Implementation
[discrete]
====== Model
The following method is introduced in `ModelManager` to display to the user the next card in the test session.

`ModelManager#testNextCard()` - returns true if it successfully finds a next card to present in the test session and
false otherwise (if there is no more cards left to test in the folder).

[discrete]
====== UI
To display the next card in the test session, the method below is introduced in `MainWindow`.

* `MainWindow#handleNextCardTestSession(Card card)` - deletes the current `TestSession` page and adds a new
`TestSession` page with this next card specified.

[discrete]
====== Example Usage of next command

To illustrate how the `UI`, `Model` and `Logic` components interact, below is a walkthrough of a typical usage scenario of
the next command.
<<nextcommandsequencediagram>> is a sequence diagram that summarises `Model` and `Logic` interactions, namely steps 1
to 6.

**Step 1**. User is in a test session and wants to move on to the next card by executing a `next`.

**Step 2**. A `NextCommand` object is created and `LogicManager` executes the `NextCommand`, storing the result and
then transferring control to the Model component, with `Model#getState()` and
`ModelManager#isCardAlreadyAnswered()` to check that user is indeed in a test session and has attempted an
answer already. (This is omitted from <<nextcommandsequencediagram>> for simplicity.)

[NOTE]
If the user is not in a test session or has not attempted an answer for the current card, this `next` command would be
rendered invalid. Step 3 would not proceed and an error message is displayed.

**Step 3**. After both checks have passed, `ModelManager#testNextCard()` method is invoked, which does the following:

1. `currentTestedCardIndex` incremented by 1.
2. `currentTestedCardIndex` is then checked if it equals to the size of `currentTestedCardFolder`.
* Case 1: This check returns true. +
This means `currentTestedCardIndex` is invalid and there
is no more next card to be presented to the user. This method immediately returns false.

* Case 2: This check returns true. +
This means `currentTestedCardIndex` is valid and will be used to get the next card
 from `currentTestedCardFolder`. This card is set as the `currentTestedCard` via the `ModelManager#setCurrentTestedCard
(cardToTest)`. `ModelManager#setCardAsNotAnswered` is then invoked to reset the value of `cardAlreadyAnswered`. This
method returns true.

**Step 4**. From the result of `ModelManager#testNextCard()` method earlier:

* Case 1: Method returns false. +
A `next` command will be equivalent to an `end` command. `ModelManager#endTestSession()` is invoked. Step 5 does not
proceed. Instead, step 3 and onwards of the <<exampleusageofendcommand>> takes over.

* Case 2: Method returns true.
For `NextCommand` to obtain the next card to present in the test session, `ModelManager#getCurrentTestedCard()` is
invoked and the `Card`, `c`, is returned.

**Step 5**. With control now transferred back to the logic unit, `NextCommand` creates a `CommandResult` object, `r` with
the type `SHOW_NEXT_CARD`, and set `testSessionCard` in `CommandResult` to `c`.

**Step 6**. `r` is returned to `LogicManager` which then terminates and returns `r` to the caller method.

**Step 7**. The caller method here is in `MainWindow`. Control is now transferred to the UI component.

**Step 8**. `MainWindow` sees that `CommandResult` object `r` has the type `SHOW_NEXT_CARD`. It invokes
`MainWindow#handleNextCardTestSession(currentTestedCard)` to display this new `currentTestedCard` question and hints
to the user.

[[nextcommandsequencediagram]]
.Component interactions for a `next` command
image::NextCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: Behavior of next command executed on the last card

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**:  A `next` command will be equivalent to an `end` command
** Pros: More convenient and user-friendly. It is common sense to end the test session for the user.
** Cons: By right, it is not correct since next command is just to show the next card.

* **Alternative 2**: A `next` command will throw an exception
** Pros: Most correct way to do it since there is no next card to display.
** Cons: User may not understand. It is not user-friendly as user has to keep track of which card it is at to prevent the exception thrown.

*Evaluation*:
With our target audience in mind, Alternative 1 is the more user friendly and intuitive way to handle this scenario.



// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature

[NOTE]
The following section details a feature implemented in the earlier iteration of the application. As such, the diagrams still refer to `AddressBook`, which has since replaced with `CardFolder`. The outdated diagrams here will be updated by `v2.0`.

==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedCardFolder`.
It extends `CardFolder` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `cardFolderStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedCardFolder#commit()` -- Saves the current card folder state in its history.
* `VersionedCardFolder#undo()` -- Restores the previous card folder state from its history.
* `VersionedCardFolder#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone card folder state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitCardFolder()`, `Model#undoCardFolder()` and `Model#redoCardFolder()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedCardFolder` will be initialized with the initial card folder state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single card folder state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th card in the card folder. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCardFolder()`, causing the modified state of the card folder after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `cardFolderStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted card folder state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add q/Some question ...` to add a new card. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitCardFolder()`, causing another modified card folder state to be saved into the `cardFolderStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCardFolder()`, so the card folder state will not be saved into the `cardFolderStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the card was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCardFolder()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous card folder state, and restores the card folder to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial card folder state, then there are no previous card folder states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCardFolder()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoCardFolder()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the card folder to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `cardFolderStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest card folder state, then there are no undone card folder states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCardFolder()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the card folder, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitCardFolder()`, `Model#undoCardFolder()` or `Model#redoCardFolder()`. Thus, the `cardFolderStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitCardFolder()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `cardFolderStateList`, all card folder states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add q/Some question ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire card folder.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the card being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of card folder states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedCardFolder`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link: https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/tree/master/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are
 the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link: https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/tree/master/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link: https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/tree/master/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.knowitall.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.knowitall.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.knowitall.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.knowitall.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link: https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/knowitall/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, card folder depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* medicine students who need to rote memorisation of information
* finds carrying physical flashcards around troublesome and prefers an application to help them store and organize
their learning material
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: flashcards that are able to test the user instead of simply having them recall the answer. The
user experience is more engaging and scoring is more accurate as it is based on actual performance rather than reported performance.

 in the folder are listed.
.. Test case: `test` +
   Expected: Enters a test session, where the display area enters a fullscreen and the lowest scoring
   flashcard question and hints (if any) will be displayed first. `In Test Session` is shown on the status message
   and status bar.
.. Test case: `test` on an empty folder (this folder has no cards) +
   Expected: The error `This command is not valid on an empty folder` is shown in the status message. Status bar
   remains the same (still in folder).
.. Test case: `test` when not inside a folder (prerequisite not fulfilled, like being in the home directory, already
in a test session or in report display) +
   Expected: The error `Command can only be executed in folder` is shown in the status message. Status bar
   remains the same.

. Ends a current test session

.. Prerequisites: Enter a test session by typing `test` when inside a folder. Display area enters fullscreen and
lowest scoring flashcard question and hints are displayed. Tester can also be in any state in the test session
.. Test case: `end` +
